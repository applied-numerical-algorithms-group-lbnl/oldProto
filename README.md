# Proto
Proto is a middleware layer that allows performance portability in scientific computations on structured grids. 
- Proto has a high-level interface to enable stencil computations and pointwise calculations with a minimum of code.  This productivity layer makes for much cleaner and smaller scientific codes.
- Proto allows users to have performance portability between platformas (including accelerator-based platforms) without having to change user code.
- Proto includes data structures which support embedded boundary (EB) calculations.  Embedded boundary calculations done properly require data to live on a more complex graph structure than simple arrays can support. 


# Proto is now in beta release.

1. All documents (including the reference manual) are available to everyone.   
2. A version of Proto with self-contained support of AMR will be released in Fall of 2021.
3. If you wish to use proto (as a beta user), we are happy to accommodate you.  Send email to dtgraves@lbl.gov for access.
